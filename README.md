Wedding Website üíçüéâ

Hello, guest! This is a personal project developed for my own wedding. The goal was to create a custom platform to manage all event details, interact with guests, and share our story in a unique way.

The website was developed entirely in Portuguese, as we are Brazilian.

Key Features
The site includes a number of features to enhance the guest experience:
RSVP System: An interactive system for real-time guest confirmation.
Responsive Design: The layout was optimized to work perfectly on mobile and desktop devices, with elegant CSS animations and transitions.
Interactive Timeline: A dedicated section to tell the couple's story.
Event Information: Details about the ceremony and party, including a map and useful tips for guests.
